# Sales-Representative-App---Angular-Material
Sales Representative app is a small app which shows the list of customers, and their detail page.
This consists of three screens.
- Login Page
- Customer list
- Customer Detail page. 

When users login, system will bring the list of customers.
On customers list page. User can see
- ID of the customer
- Name of the customer
- Customer's product
- And the status of the customer

User can also refresh, sort and filter the list of customers. 

Clicking on any list item system will take user to another screen which has details of the clicked customer. 
- Here user can make a skype call (Skye API intergrated)
- Phone call with cell phone.
- Email
- Can write notes and change the status of the customer. 
- Can schedule a visit on specified date and time with notes. 

Bootstrap is used to make this app responsive. 

Note: Originally, I used a backend REST services (Provided by Crossover) to fetch details of the customer and authentication. But I have not included that backend in this repo.
