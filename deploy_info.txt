Prerequisites
- JDK 1.7		

- My SQL 			


Note
"backend" folder contains:
- db.sql 				
- SQL file for schema and data to be used in app.
- deploy_info.txt			
- Details for setting up backend
- SRA.jar				
- Web Archive file to be executed
- “src” folder 				
- contains config files for backend

Please follow the following steps to properly setup the backend.


STEPS:
- Setup the database using the following command
	
- mysql -u <username> -p<password> 
	
- CREATE DATABASE sales_rep
	
- use sales_rep
	- source ‘path/to/db.sql’

- To start the server, run the following command
	
- java -jar SRA.jar 

Assuming “src” folder is in same directory as in “SRA.jar” and no other server is running at port 8080.

Server will start at http://locahost:8080/


Note:
My SQL username and password used in backend code are “root” and “password”. 
If your local My SQL setup has different username and password you can set the same in “backend/sales_rep/middleware.js”
